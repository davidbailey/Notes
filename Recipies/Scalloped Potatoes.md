# Scalloped Potatoes

## Ingredients
- 4 Tbsp butter
- 4 Tbsp flour
- 1.5-2 cups of milk
- 2 cups thinly sliced peeled Russet potatoes (will probably take 3 large potatoes).
 
## Directions
1) Preheat oven to 350.
2) Melt the butter in a large saucepan under low heat.
3) Slowly whisk in the flour.
4) Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently.  Do not allow it to brown; keep the temperature low.
5) Slowly add the milk, stirring it in. During the course of adding the milk, raise the temperature to medium.
6) Continue to cook until gentle bubbles form.  You do not want a full boil.  You are looking for a consistency that will coat the back of a spoon.
7) Scatter the sliced potatoes in a low pyrex dish.
8) Slowly pour in the sauce, lifting the potatoes as necessary to evenly distribute the sauce.  Make sure you’ve made enough sauce….
9) Dot with additional butter if you want more flavor and calories.
10) Generously salt and pepper to taste.
11)  Bake at 350  degrees for 50-60 minutes, checking occasionally.  It’s done when you can easily pierce the potatoes with a sharp knife.  The surface should be lightly browned and bubbly.
 
Serves 6.
