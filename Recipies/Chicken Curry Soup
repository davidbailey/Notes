Ingredients
1​medium/small yellow onion, chopped
4​carrots, peeled & chopped
6 tsp​butter
3 tsp​curry powder
1​chicken, cut into pieces (breasts, legs, thighs, etc)
½ cup ​rice
6 sprigs​parsley
4-5 ​15 oz cans chicken broth, low salt, low fat
½ cup ​frozen peas
½ cup​Half & Half
 
Directions
1) Melt butter in large soup pot.
2) Add chopped onion, chopped carrots, curry powder.
3) Stew over low heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4) Add chicken pieces, chicken broth, parseley, and rice.
5) Cook 50 minutes (or until chicken is cooked).
6) Remove chicken pieces and remove meat from bones.  Pull the meat apart into bite-sized pieces.
7) Either:
a. run the broth/vegetables mixture through a food mill, or use a stick blender (eg, Braun Stick Blender), or
b. leave as is – depending upon your preference.  We like the finer texture, so use a stick blender.  If you like a coarser texture – like a peasant soup – just leave as is.
8) Return the chicken meat and the vegetable/broth mix to the pot.
9) Add the frozen peas and the Half & Half.
10) Heat to preference.
 
Serves 4.  Serve with baguette of French or sourdough bread.  We think it tastes better the second day.
