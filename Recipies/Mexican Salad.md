## Ingredients
* can of corn
* can of black beans (rinsed - like, for all of the cans, I'd say a good rule of thumb is to rinse before eating anyways)
* beefsteak tomato (or a couple roma tomatoes)
* cilantro, chopped
* 1/2 red onion, finely shopped
* juice of a lime
* cumin, to taste
* cayenne pepper, to taste
* salt and peppa, to taste
* Optional: red, green, yellow, etc. peppers, chopped

## Directions
... I think that is all?! Then just mix mix mix! Sometimes I pair with some chicken on the side.
