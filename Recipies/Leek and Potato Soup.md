# Leek and Potato Soup

## Ingredients
* 4 oz. butter – no substitute
* 3 cups chopped leeks (the white part and the base of the green leaves; remove the roots)
* 2 stalks celery, chopped
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 3-4 cups roughly chopped potatoes (leave skins on unless they’re very thick)
* 2 quarts chicken broth – use Swanson’s no fat, low salt
* 1-2 cups cream
* Salt and pepper to taste
 
## Directions
1) Melt butter in a saucepan big enough to hold all ingredients.  
2) Add leeks, celery, and onion and stew slowly over medium-low heat until golden and soft.  Don’t let them brown.  
3) Add potatoes and chicken broth and bring to a boil.  
4) Reduce heat and let simmer until potatoes are cooked through – anywhere from 20-40 minutes.  
5) Mash potatoes or roughly puree with a stick blender.   You want a mildly lumpy texture, not a smooth puree like mashed potatoes.
6) Add cream and salt and pepper.  
7) Heat through again.  

Serves 4-6.   Enjoy!
