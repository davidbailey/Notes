### Start with

* 1 yellow onion, chopped
* 3 cloves of garlic, minced           
* In the soup saucepan cook onion and garlic in 2 Tablespoons of olive oil on medium heat, until soft - but don’t let it brown, takes about 10 minute.

### Add

* 2 cans of veggie or chicken broth or a can of each,
* 1 can of white beans (drained and rinsed)
* 1 cup of thin-skinned red potatoes, chopped bite-sized (don’t peel)
* 1 can of diced tomatoes w. the juice
* 1 cup of chopped kale.
* Salt and pepper to taste.  Add a bit of cayenne pepper to taste.
* Simmer on low heat until the potatoes are soft, about 15 minutes.
* Use your hand blender and lightly blend the soup.  You want a mixture of blended and whole pieces so go easy.
* Add ½ cup of cream.  Heat to eating temperature and go at it.
* For your meat-eating friends you can add ¼ to½ pound of  sausage, browned and drained of fat.   I used a turkey sausage.  Add after you do the blending.  Don’t know if there’s some veggie meat substitute.
* Enjoy.   It’s fast and easy and keeps in the fridge.
